# CZ3003-SSAD

This repo covers the project submission required for CZ3003. This module was a real tough one, as it required us to create a game from scratch that must meet all project requirements. In addition, a ton of documentations were required. Feel free to use our repo as a reference.

This was a group project and a big thanks to Yew Heng, Jerms and Wei Hua for your hard work.
